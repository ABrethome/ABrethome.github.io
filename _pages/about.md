With a PhD in both organic chemistry and data science, I thrive at the interface of both disciplines, 
where I can bring my deep knowledge of chemistry, statistical modeling and machine learning to deliver 
the most value to a business. Quick learner and understanding both worlds, I bridge the gap in projects,
enabling my fellow chemists to achieve more through digitalisation.
